# No monorail trains

NewGRF for [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/) that disables monorail. Pairs well with the [no maglev](https://github.com/rexxars/openttd-no-maglev) NewGRF!

## Why?

I prefer regular trains! Having the monorail trains around when playing against other people/AIs makes it hard to stick with the regular trains, though. With this, everyone is on the same page.
